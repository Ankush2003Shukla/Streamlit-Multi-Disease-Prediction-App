# Streamlit-Multi-Disease-Prediction-App

Welcome to the Multi-Disease Prediction App repository! This repository contains a Streamlit web application for predicting three common diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer. The predictive models are implemented using machine learning algorithms and deployed using Streamlit.

## About the App

The Multi-Disease Prediction App allows users to input relevant medical data and receive predictions for diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer. Each prediction model is trained on a dataset containing relevant features and labels, enabling accurate predictions based on user inputs.

## Features

- **Diabetes Prediction:** Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, and BMI.
- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Predicts the risk of heart disease based on user input features such as age, cholesterol level, and blood pressure.
- **Breast Cancer Prediction:** Predicts the probability of breast cancer based on user input features such as tumor size, tumor grade, and patient age.

## Deployment

The Multi-Disease Prediction App is deployed using Streamlit and can be accessed using the following link:
